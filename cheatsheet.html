                    In the web, resources such as HTML pages, images, stylesheets, scripts, and other
                    files are addressed using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). A URL is a reference or
                    address used to access resources on the internet. URLs have a specific syntax and consist
                    of several components:
                </p>
                <h4>Scheme: </h4>
                <p>
                    It indicates the protocol used to acces the resources. Common schemes include
                    'http', 'https' 'ftp', etc. For example, in the URL 'https://www.yt.com, https is the
                    scheme.
                </p>

            <h3>3. What are the general components of a url?</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose. The
                    general components of a URL are:
                </p>
                <h4>Host:</h4>
                <p>
                    It specifies the domain or IP address of the server hosting the resource. In the URL
                    'https://www.yt.com' 'www.yt.com' is the host.
                </p>
                <h4>Path:</h4>
                <p>
                    It identifies the specific resources or location on the server. For example, in the URL
                    'https://www.yt.com/page1.html', page1.html is the path.
                </p>
                <h4>Port:</h4>
                <p>
                    (optional) If a specific port on the server is used, it is specified in the URL after a colon
                    For example, 'https://www.example.com:8080; where 8080 is the port number.

            <h3>1. What is a web server?</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    A web server is software that serves requests made by clients on the World Wide Web. It is responsible for handling and responding
                    to HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients,
                    typically web browsers.
                    The primary function of a web server is to deliver web pages and other content to users. A web server is a foundational component of the internet infrastructure,
                    responsible for delivering web content to users and facilitating the exchange of information between clients and servers.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h3>2. What does a web server?</h3>
            <section>
                <P>
                    A web server is a crucial component of the internet infrastructure that plays a fundamental role in delivering web content to users around the world. Its primary function is to handle and respond to HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests initiated by clients, typically web browsers.
                    When a user enters a URL in their browser or clicks on a link, a request is sent to the web server associated with that URL. The web server then processes the request, fetching the requested resources—such as HTML pages, images, stylesheets, scripts, or other files—from its storage.
                    Web servers are capable of serving both static and dynamic content. Static content includes files that remain unchanged, like HTML documents and images, while dynamic content is generated on-the-fly by applications running on the server. These applications often use server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Python, or Ruby.
                    The communication between the client and the server is facilitated through the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. The latter provides a secure, encrypted connection, particularly crucial for handling sensitive information such as login credentials or financial transactions.
                    Popular web server software includes Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed. These servers can be configured to handle various tasks, such as setting up virtual hosts to host multiple websites on a single server, managing security settings to protect against potential threats, and optimizing performance for faster content delivery.

            <h3>3. How can content be stored on a web server?</h3>
            <section>
                <p>

                    Content storage on a web server is a fundamental aspect of web development,
                    involving structured file systems and organization. A hierarchical directory structure,
                    starting with a root directory, manages static content like HTML and images as discrete files.
                    Dynamic content is generated on the server using scripting languages. Content Management
                    Systems often utilize databases for flexibility, separating content from design.
                    Version control systems like Git track changes for collaborative development.
                    Media directories and caching mechanisms enhance security and performance.
                    This meticulous approach ensures efficient, secure, and adaptable content delivery for web-based applications and websites.

            <h3>4. How is content in webpages described?</h3>
            <section>
                <p>

                    Content in webpages is described using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
                    HTML is the standard markup language for creating and structuring content
                    on the web. It uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs,
                    images, links, and more. Each HTML tag provides instructions on how the
                    content should be displayed and formatted in the browser. Additionally,
                    attributes within tags offer further details or functionality. Web developers
                    use HTML to organize and present information, ensuring a consistent and
                    understandable layout for users accessing the webpage through browsers.
                    The combination of HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and sometimes JavaScript
                    forms the backbone of how content is described, styled, and interacted with on the modern web.

                    A web client refers to the user's device or software application that requests and consumes
                    content or services from a web server. Typically, a web client is a web browser like Chrome,
                    Firefox, or Safari, but it can also be other applications or devices that interact with web services.
                    The web client sends requests to web servers, retrieves and displays the received content, such as HTML
                    pages, images, and multimedia, and facilitates user interactions with web applications. It acts as the interface
                    through which users access and interact with information on the internet, interpreting and rendering
                    content received from web servers. Web clients play a crucial role in the user's online experience, providing
                    a gateway to navigate and engage with the vast array of content and services available on the World Wide Web.

            <section>
                <p>
                    The HTML 'head' element is a container for metadata in a web document. It includes essential information such as the document title ('title'),
                    character set, viewport settings, and links to external resources like stylesheets and favicons. JavaScript and inline styles may also be included.
                    The 'head' element does not display content directly to the user but plays a crucial role in defining the document's properties and linking necessary resources.

            <h3>2. What does "!Doctype html" mean?</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    The '!DOCTYPE html' declaration is a fundamental instruction at the beginning of an HTML document, serving as a specifier for the HTML version in use. Specifically,
                    '!DOCTYPE html' indicates adherence to the HTML5 standard, which is the latest iteration of the HTML specification.
                    This declaration is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it defines the Document Type and Version (DTD) of HTML, acting as a guide for browsers and validators.
                    Secondly, it helps browsers determine whether to render the page in quirks mode or standards mode. In modern browsers, encountering '!DOCTYPE html'
                    typically triggers standards mode, promoting consistent rendering across different platforms.
                    Moreover, the '!DOCTYPE html' declaration plays a role in document validation. Validators use it to ensure that the HTML document adheres to the specifications of the declared version.

                <p>
                    n the hierarchy of an HTML document, the two topmost elements within the 'html' element are the 'head' and 'body' elements. The 'head' element typically contains metadata such as character set,
                    viewport settings, and the document title. It serves as a space for information about the document. On the other hand, the 'body' element encompasses the visible content of the HTML document.
                    This includes elements like headings, paragraphs, and interactive components—the content users interact with or view on the page. The division between the 'head' and 'body' elements helps in
                    organizing and structuring both document-related information and user-visible content.

            <section>
                <p>
                    In the browser, the emphasized text is typically displayed with italicized formatting for 'em' and bold formatting for 'strong'. However,
                    the actual rendering can be influenced by CSS styles applied to the document. It's important to note that these elements carry semantic meaning,
                    indicating emphasis rather than dictating a specific style. Browsers, assistive technologies, and search engines can use this semantic information
                    to enhance accessibility and user experience.

            <section>
                <p>
                    In HTML, the 'mark' element is used to mark up and highlight text that holds particular importance or relevance within a document.
                    This element is applied to emphasize key content, making it visually distinct from the surrounding text. When rendered in a browser,
                    the text within the 'mark' element is typically displayed with a background color to bring attention to its significance. It's essential
                    to use the 'mark' element thoughtfully, ensuring that its application enhances the user's comprehension and adheres to accessibility principles.
                    Strategic usage of mark contributes to improved visual hierarchy and clarity in conveying important information.
